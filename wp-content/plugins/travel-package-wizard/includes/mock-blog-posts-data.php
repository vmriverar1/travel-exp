        'content' => '<p>Planning your trip to Machu Picchu? Here are the top 10 tips that every traveler should know before visiting this incredible Wonder of the World.</p>

<h2>1. Book Your Tickets in Advance</h2>
<p>Machu Picchu has a daily visitor limit of 4,500 people. Tickets sell out weeks or even months in advance, especially during peak season (May-September).</p>

<h2>2. Choose the Right Time to Visit</h2>
<p>The dry season (April to October) offers the best weather, but it\'s also the busiest. The wet season (November to March) has fewer crowds and lush green landscapes.</p>

<h2>3. Acclimatize to the Altitude</h2>
<p>Spend at least 2-3 days in Cusco (3,400m) before visiting Machu Picchu to avoid altitude sickness. Drink coca tea and take it easy.</p>

<h2>4. Arrive Early</h2>
<p>The first bus leaves Aguas Calientes at 5:30 AM. Arriving early means fewer crowds and better photo opportunities.</p>

<h2>5. Hire a Guide</h2>
<p>A knowledgeable guide will bring the history and stories of Machu Picchu to life. Tours typically last 2-3 hours.</p>',

        'content' => '<p>Rainbow Mountain (Vinicunca) has become one of Peru\'s most Instagram-famous destinations. But is it worth the hype? Here\'s everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>What is Rainbow Mountain?</h2>
<p>At 5,200 meters (17,060 feet), Vinicunca displays stunning natural colors caused by mineral deposits: red from iron oxide, yellow from sulfur, and green from copper.</p>

<h2>The Trek</h2>
<p>The standard route is a 14km (8.7 miles) round trip, typically taking 3-4 hours to ascend and 2 hours to descend. The altitude makes it challenging.</p>

<h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
<p>Dry season (April-October) offers the best visibility. The colors are most vibrant in the morning when the sun hits the mountain.</p>

<h2>Altitude Sickness Prevention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend 2-3 days in Cusco first</li>
<li>Drink coca tea</li>
<li>Go slowly and breathe deeply</li>
<li>Consider altitude sickness medication</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tour vs DIY</h2>
<p>Most visitors take a guided tour from Cusco (departure at 3 AM, return by 5 PM). Independent travel is possible but requires a rental car and early start.</p>',
